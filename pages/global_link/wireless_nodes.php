                The Global Link wireless lighting control system is comprised of a site controller and individual
                nodes. Each controller and node is outfitted with its own memory, allowing wireless communication with
                or without an internet connection. Nodes in each lighting kit communicate with a controller, which ties
                into a server that can be accessed remotely.

                By optimizing lighting efficiency through management and control, users are able to reduce operation
                costs while maintaining quality light output and security.
