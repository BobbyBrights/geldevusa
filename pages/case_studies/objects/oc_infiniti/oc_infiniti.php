            An Orange County car dealership recently implemented Global Energy & Lighting’s CeramaTek® solution.
            The exterior lot had been illuminated by an aging 1000-watt metal-halide (MH) system, which cast bland
            light on the inventory. <br><br>

            Management chose to retrofit existing fixtures with 315-watt CeramaTek® kits to enhance product lighting and
            maximize efficiency. The MH lamp’s rated color rendering index (CRI, a measure of a light source’s fidelity
            to natural light) of 75 was overmatched by a rating of 93+ from the CeramaTek® system, which will provide
            intensity and vibrancy far beyond that of the old lights. Additionally, CeramaTek® outperforms the MH’s
            20,000-hour rated life, easily reaching a minimum of 50,000 hours. <br><br>

            The install provided an annual energy savings of 71% over the MH system, and reduced the dealership’s
            carbon footprint by 113 tons. With a 1 year ROI, the dealership has realized an impressive boost to their bottom line.
