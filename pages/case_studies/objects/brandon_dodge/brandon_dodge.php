            Since 2010, Brandon Dodge has been meeting the Denver metro area’s need for premium quality new and used
            vehicles. The 400,000 square-foot site was illuminated by an aging metal-halide (MH) system, casting low
            quality light on the inventory. In 2014, management decided it was time for an upgrade, selecting Global
            Energy & Lighting’s CeramaTek® kits for the project. <br><br>

            Randolfo Dust, co-owner of Progressive Energy Solutions, was the energy service agent behind the Brandon
            Dodge project, and carried out the install. When contacted about the retrofit he remarked, “CeramaTek® kits
            are an effective solution. Very simple to install and at Brandon Dodge were able to realize 57% energy
            savings, much better color rendering, and lamps that will last more than 10 years. This is just a win–win
            deal for everyone.” <br><br>

            The new 210-watt CeramaTek® system replaced 400-watt MHs, and will provide a color
            rendering index of 92+ (CRI, a measure of a light source’s fidelity to natural light), intensifying the
            vibrancy of colors, especially when compared to the metal-halide CRI of 75.  <br><br>

            By retrofitting the entire complex, Brandon Dodge went from using more than 168,000 kWh annually to less
            than 82,000. This 57% reduction in energy use makes for a 10-year savings of over $174,000. And what’s
            more, the dealership will reduce their carbon footprint by more than 116,000 lbs., the equivalent to
            removing 13 cars from US roads.
