            A southern California shopping center in Fresno, CA, hosts more than 75 stores and services on nearly 45
            acres. In 2013, the property owner implemented a lighting retrofit in order to enhance patrons’ shopping
            experience, as well as maximize energy efficiency. <br><br>

            To meet their goals, the principal chose to upgrade the property’s dated high-pressure sodium (HPS) parking
            lot lighting scheme with Global Energy & Lighting’s CeramaTek® solution. The yellow-orange glow of the
            failing 1000-watt HPS parking lot system was easily retrofitted with Global’s 375-watt kit. The new system
            provides an industry leading 125 lm/W, and a color rendering index (CRI, a measure of a light source’s
            fidelity to natural light) of 90+, allowing the highest quality light while maximizing energy efficiency.
            The enhanced lighting promotes safety and security in the parking area, allowing for a more pleasant
            shopping experience. <br><br>

            The project is realizing an annual energy savings of 65%, while reducing the center’s carbon footprint by
            more than 52 tons.<br>
