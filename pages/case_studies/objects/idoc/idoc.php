                New Lighting, Significant Savings for IDOC

                Brighter, clearer lighting is delivering dividends to the Idaho Department of
                Correction (IDOC), enabling employees to see remarkable detail on security cameras
                and enhancing visibility in the yard.<br><br>

                Utilizing existing fixtures, Global Energy & Lighting’s 375-watt CeramaTek® kits were
                installed atop 50’ poles in the yard area, replacing older 1000-watt high-pressure
                sodium (HPS) technology. Dim and yellow-hued lighting has been supplanted by,
                bright, white light, with excellent clarity that is much appreciated by the prison staff.<br><br>

                Michael McCabe, construction manager for IDOC, saw an immediate difference in
                clarity on the security cameras as well as from guard posts in the yard. With a
                reduction of 70% in energy use, the new lighting had an aggressive ROI of only 2 years.
                With an expected lamp life of 50,000 hours, IDOC will realize tremendous savings
                on maintenance costs over the aging HPS system’s 20,000 hour life.<br><br>

                The energy savings translate into tangible environmental impact reductions,
                demonstrating the agency’s clear commitment to sustainability. The project also had
                an impact on the night sky, wasting minimal less light and reducing light pollution
                over the yellow-orange glow of the HPS lamps. With the light pools contained, there is
                more focus on the efficient use of light to assist in providing the highest level of
                security.

                        The 315W Ceramatek kits provide us with significant energy savings of
                        about 70%, and staff and inmates have given many compliments on
                        the quality of the new lighting.”
